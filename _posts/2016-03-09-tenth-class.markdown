Today was the last day of class :(  
We reviewed the material we learned throughout the quarter, which included the visual information-seeking mantra, visual encoding, biases, and the visualization tools.
The [review slides](/bime591/archive/BioViz_Review.pptx) are in the class archive.  

But wait, there's more!
Since many of you were interested in D3, we gave you a crash course on what D3 is, and how it works.  

Hopefully this has been an informative course, and thank you all for being a part of it!  

\- Graham, Nikhil, and Uba.
